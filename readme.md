# Code Memorization

After choking on a couple of "whiteboarding" interview questions, I am realizing that I have very much been a "copy/paste" developer. Is this a horrible thing? I would say not comletely.

I know what I want the code to do, and I know how to quickly find the answer.

But if you ask me to code live, I get so nervous that remembering a simple "for loop" or list of "if else" statements becomes a problem. This is not helping me impress people or get a paying developer job. I know I need to recall at least the basics (and beyond) from memory while under pressure.

Another issue I have is that I don't always know exactly what the code body is doing every step of the way. I just know how to find and install the snippets I need. While this still requires some brainpower on my part for research, debuggin and customization, the process can be slow and inefficient.

# Action Plan

To begin tackling these issues: I am going to try a few things:
* Typing functions over and over to instill brain and muscle memory
* Dissect and comment on the code so I know what each element of a function or app component is doing.
* Blog about the code that I'm writing in order to solidify my understanding of the code/concepts and not just how to regurgitate the code needed.
